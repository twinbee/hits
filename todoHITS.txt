todo HITS paper:

shorten (8 pages w/o ref.)
add motivation, techniques for parallelization

add analysis

remove some of the summary for HITS algorithm


write Abstract:
page ranking lots of pages
topological structure

motivation for parallelization:
volume of data is great, serialized version time expensive n^2, grows with graph size
--- utilize our machines to max effect

break up the independant parts into smaller versions, run in parallel
